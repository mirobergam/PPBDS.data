\description{
This is a dataset corresponding to the paper "Longevity Returns to Political
Office" by \href{https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2019.63}{Barfort, Klemmensen &
Larsen (2019)}. The purpose of this study was to find out whether and how
winning an election influences the lifespan of politicians. To answer this
question, the authors collected data on all U.S. gubernatorial elections from
1945 to 2012. In addition to the names and votes of the running candidates, the
data includes information on their pre- and post-election life spans. See also the
'Details' section below.

\details{
To facilitate subsequent analysis, the raw data collected by the authors was
edited in three ways. First, for a given election, only the two candidates who
received the highest number of votes were included. Second, candidates with unknown
dates of death were excluded, resulting in fewer observations for elections in
recent years. Third, in a few instances, only the year of birth or death could
be determined; in these cases, the date was taken to be July 1 of that year.
