# This dataset is from Barfort, Klemmensen & Larsen (2019), and was originally
# used in a paper published in Political Science and Research Methods. Details
# of the study can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2019.63, the raw
# data used here is available at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/IBKYRX,

# Reading in the data. I excluded variables that indicate a candidate's middle
# name ("cand_middle"), and  whether a candidate was living at the time the study was
# conducted ("living"). Neither variable provides meaningful insights, and excluding
# them keeps the dataset concise. Next, I excluded variables that indicate the actual
# number of days a candidate lived before ("living_days_pre") and after the election
# ("living_days_post"). It makes little sense to include both the actual and the
# imputed version of these variables, so I decided to exclude the former. Also, I
# excluded variables indicating the annual population in a state ("pop_annual"), annual
# increases in per capita income ("pc_inc_ann"), total expenditures ("tot_expenditure"),
# and life expectancy of a candidate in remaining years ("ex"). These variables may be
# interesting, but have way too many NAs to be useful. Finally, I excluded four variables
# indicating the the census region in which an election took place ("reg_south", "reg_west",
# "reg_midwest", "reg_northeast"). This adds little information, given that we already have
# a variable indicating the federal state in which an election took place.
