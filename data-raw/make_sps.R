# Public policy for the poor? A randomised assessment of the Mexican universal
# health insurance programme (2009)

# The treatment consisted of encouragement to enroll in a health-insurance
# programme and upgraded medical facilities. Participant states also received
# funds to improve health facilities and to provide medications for services in
# treated clusters.

# The outcome variables:

# Catastrophic expenditures decreased w/ treatment
# Effect in poor households was 3·0% points -- 30%
# Effect in experimental compliers was 6·5% points -- 59%


#  intention-to-treat effect on health spending in poor households was 426
#  pesos (39–812), and the complier average causal eff ect was 915 pesos
#  (147–1684)



# P03D11 Health care costs, excluding travel expenses related to seeking health
# care and any reimbursement of health insurance? (of the past month)

# From the readme on dataverse: A codebook for the survey questionnaire appears
# in both Spanish and English. The survey question codes appear in the
# questionnaire exactly as they appear in the dataset.  (Note, however, that on
# the English form the questions above Section 7 should be labeled one section
# higher; e.g., the code for Question 7.1 is P08D01, not P07D01).

# I was a bit confused on the note about the difference in code for the English
# and Spanish version because it is not clear which codebook the data file uses.
# What I did: I identified that the questionnaire is divided into sections. P is
# the section and 'd' is the question itself. Using the english questionnaire, I
# identified some variables I thought were interesting. These variables can
# certainly change to fit the needs and interests of the class.
