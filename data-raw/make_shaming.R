# This dataset is from Gerber, Green & Larimer (2008), and was originally
# published as part of a study in the American Political Science Review.
# The raw data and details of the study can be accessed at
# https://isps.yale.edu/research/data/d001. [UPDATE: As of 07/08/20, the website
# of Yale's Institute of Social and Policy Studies is currently not accessible.]

# Reading in the data. I excluded variables that represent internal IDs the
# researchers assigned to households ("hh_id") and clusters of randomization
# ("cluster"), as well as variables that show the mean voter turnout per household
# in the 2004 elections ("p2004_mean" and "g2004_mean"). None of these are particularly
# relevant for analyzing and interpreting the data. Furthermore, I also excluded two
# variables that show the voting histories of the 2000 elections ("p2000" and "g2000").
# They provide little insight in addition to the remaining histories from 2002 and 2004,
# and we do not want to overwhelm people.
