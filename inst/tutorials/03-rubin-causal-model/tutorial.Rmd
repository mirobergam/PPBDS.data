We are only able to calculate the true average treatment effect for this sample of individuals because this is an Ideal Preceptor Table, which includes all of the observed and counterfactual values. In reality, we wouldn't be able to get both the treatment and control outcomes for any single individual.  
The console has provided for your convenience to solve for the ATE of this sample. Nothing you type in the console will be graded.
